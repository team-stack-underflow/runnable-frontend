# runnable

Runnable is a mobile device application that allows users to access coding environments to evaluate code on the go. It is built and maintained by 2 NUS students as part of a project submission for [Orbital 2020](https://nusskylab-dev.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

The frontend of Runnable is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app, written in [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour), and edited using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
